Welcome to the Gossip-Based Systems research repository! This project explores the fundamental concepts, implementation, and applications of Gossip Dissemination in distributed systems, particularly focusing on its impact on blockchain technologies.

### Prerequisites
- advanced Golang knowledge 
- working in distributed systes before
- IDEs ðŸ«¢

### Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EncrypteDL/Gossip-Based-Systems.git
cd Gossip-Based-Systems
```

## Conclusion:

Gossip dissemination is a powerful tool in distributed systems, providing a decentralized, fault-tolerant, and scalable way to spread information across a network. It is particularly well-suited to environments where nodes can fail, join, or leave frequently, and where a central coordination mechanism is undesirable or impractical.
